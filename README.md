# 🎼 AI Music Generator 🎶  
A Deep Learning-based Music Generator that creates new melodies using LSTM networks trained on MIDI files.  
**Task 3 of CodeAlpha Internship Project**

---

## 📌 Overview
This project generates music by learning from classical MIDI files using deep learning (LSTM). The model captures patterns in musical notes and creates new melodies saved as `.mid` files.

## ✅ Features
- Parses and processes classical MIDI files using `music21`
- Converts note sequences to numerical format
- Trains an LSTM neural network to learn musical patterns
- Generates new music and saves it as a `.mid` file
- Saves trained model weights for reuse
